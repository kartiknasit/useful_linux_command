Linux Commands to be remember

Commands to be run once you installed Ubuntu

add prefix sudo if need to run command as root

- sudo apt upgdade
- sudo apt full-upgrade

when we start linux automatically shell process is starts
shell is program which accepts user input and execute it
it is a command interpreter
shell gives command to linux kernel


man pages --> looked to check detail or documentation of command

man -> manual

For ex, man ls --> will display documentation of manual of command ls

we can search any string using /search_string
then to navigate each of the matches use n for next match and N (shift + n) for previous match

to go to beginning of the man page use g and to go to end press G (shift + g)

to search backward use ?serach_string

man page is only available for commands that have dedicated documentation or manuals in linux 
but man page is not available for commands that are shell built in
to check if command is built in or not
use, type command_name
to check help on this command use help command_name
help is only available for commands that are shell built in

we can also search for the exact or similar command using man
use, man -k search_string --> this will display exact or possible matches of the commands that are matched to search_string

ctrl + l -> clear -> clear the terminal 

ctrl + d -> exit from terminal

ctrl + a -> moves cursor to beginning

cttl + e -> moves cursor to end

ctrl + u -> clear the command line which we enter -> do not need to press backspace to all the way just press ctrl + u and it clears the current line of the command written
useful to password also because we cant see password and if we thought to enter wrong characters we can press ctrl + u


To check commands history -> cat .bash_history --> this file is stored in user directory
number of commands that needs to be stored is decided by environment variable -> histfilesize -> echo $HISTFILESIZE
Additionally, we can run history command to print history of bash commands
the number of commands are printed using history command is controlled by HISTSIZE environment variable --> echo $HISTSIZE

to run specific command from history --> !command_number_from_history

to run previous command withouy using up key -> !!

to check the command detail and output use -> !-number_from_the_last_command

to run last command directly with its arguments -> !command_name -> this will run command previous ran with its arguments

if you don't want to run the command and just print it then just use -> !ping:p or !rm:p -> it will display which last command was used for ping and rm

delete specific command from history --> history -d 107 --> delete command number 107 from history
delete entire history -> history -c

to not add command into history just add whitespace before running command like, --> whitespace who -a --> this will be not saved in history

if commands are still recorded in history then we can check environment variable --> HISTCONTROL
HISTCONTROL has possible three values -> ignoredups, ignorespace, ignoreboth

ignoredups -> only record history of one command if we runs the same command multiple times like, cd cd cd -> it will record only one cd in history
ignorespace -> it will not record command written using whitespace
ignoreboth -> it will not record commnd ran using whitespace and also record only one command if we run same command multiple times

by default in ubuntu this variable is set to ignoreboth and in centos it is set to ignoredups

if we change HISTCONTROL value after login it will only changed till user is logged out.
if we want to permanently store its values even after user restarts the machine we need to save it in .bashrc file
to do that run -> echo "HISTCONTROL=ignoreboth" >> .bashrc

generally history command does not show on which time command ran
to do that use -> HISTTIMEFORMAT="%d/%m/%y %T "


Gain root access -> sudo su
print your curret user access to which group -> id
it still logged in as current user but it has now admistrator rights to execute root commands

sudo su -   -> directly logged in as root --> Linux initializes all environment variable as if directly root logged in

once we run any command using sudo it will first time ask for password
but then for 5 minutes it will not ask for password and each time we run sudo command it will update time stamp and again for 5 mins not asks for password

sudo -v -> automatically updates timestamp and we don't need to run the whole command to update time stamp
sudo -k -> reset timestamp and used needs to enter password when used sudo command

by default root password is not set to set the password for root -> sudo passwd root -> prompts for password of root
once password for root is set we can just type su and it will prompt for root password and then we can logged in as root user

to change password of any user run -> sudo passwd username

home directory for root user is -> /root/
and by default root directory is -> /
so do not get confused for root user directory to root directory


File System

by default when we insert USB we need to mount it in our linux system
in gui based linux system like ubuntu it is automatically mounted
once inserted we can check USB by running -> df -h

all the hardware related files are stored in /proc folder
like, we can print cpu information using --> cat /proc/cpuinfo
there are other files are also available in this directory that we can check to analyze hardware 
/var directory used for storing system/application logs

ls displays current directory contents by default
so if we want to display current directory status and not its contet use -d option
like, ls -ld -> this command will print detail list of /etc and not its contents

file permission -> drwxrwxrwx -> indicates it is directory -> first 3 letters owner permission, group permission, other users permission

use -S option to list files as size in descending order
use -h option to see size in human readable format

by default ls command does not display original size for directory
instead we can use -> du -sh /etc/ -> to see the size of etc directory

to sort using file extension use -> ls -X
to not display specific extension file -> ls --hide=*.conf -> this will not display files that has .conf extension

to check detail or location of command use type -> type ifconfig, type ls these are some examples

file timestamp has 3 timestamps -> atime, mtime, ctime

atime -> last time file was read -> ls -lu
mtime -> last time of file content was modified -> ls -l, ls -lt
ctime -> last time when metadata of file has changed -> ls -lc

these times contains integer value which is calculated to time stamp from Jan 1 1970 UTC

to check all the time in human readable format use -> stat filename

to check full time -> ls -l --full-time filename/directory

touch usually creates the file if it does not exists in current directory and also at the same time it updates the time stamp of the file
by default if we run -> touch filename -> it updates all 3 times (atime, ctime, mtime)

to specifically modify particular time use -> touch -m filename -> it update mtime and ctime
touch -a filename -> it update atime and ctime

to modify file time stamp to previous or any specific date -> touch -at 201905200223.34 filename -> it updates only atime of the file
touch -amt 201905200223.34 filename -> it updates both atime,mtime of the file

to directly change both atime and mtime use -> touch -d "2020-04-05 14:34:23" filename

copy other file time stamp to other one use -> touch filename1.txt -r filename2.txt
it will copy time stamp of the filename2.txt to filename1.txt

to display files in sorted timestamp manner use -> ls -lt -> it displays file/directory sorting by modification time
to sort file list using access time use -> ls -ltu
to sort file using its name use -> ls -lu -> time it will shows for each file in list will be access time
to revers the order of previous command use -> ls -lu -r

to check file type use -> file filename
to rename or move file use -> mv filename1.txt filename2.txt
to move the file we need also give the file name with path -> mv filename1.txt Desktop/filename1.txt
